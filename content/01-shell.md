# Shell

The following shells will be supported:

- `bash`
  - ![bash shell](/resources/media/bash.mov)
- `zsh`
  - ![zsh stock shell](/resources/media/zsh-stock.mov)
- `zsh` with [`oh-my-zsh`](https://ohmyz.sh)
  - ![zsh custom shell](/resources/media/zsh-custom.mov)

In order to have a simplified developing experience, it is recommended to use `zsh` and `oh-my-zsh`.

Install `oh-my-zsh` with the following command:

`sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`
